.SH NAME
mux_server \- Freescale Embedded Hypervisor byte channel MUX server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmux_server\fR [-s <baud-rate>] [-exec] target port [ port ... ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The hypervisor supports multiplexed serial communications via byte channels.
In the master device tree each byte channel that is to be multiplexed specifies
a channel number in the definition of the byte channel end point.
\fImux_server\fR is a Linux-based utility provided to support multiplexing and
demultiplexing services.  \fImux_server\fR runs on a host system and attaches
to the target system via a serial or network communications channel.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBtarget\fR
The target machine that \fImux_server\fR is providing mux and demux services to.
This would typically be a serial port (e.g. /dev/ttys0) or a
hostname:port in the case of network based connection to the target.

if \fB-exec\fR is specified, \fBtarget\fR is an external command to execute.
The command must support the attachment of stdin and stdout to the target
system.
.TP
\fBport\fR
One or more network port numbers on the host running \fImux_server\fR which
applications use to connect to a channel.  The port numbers listed correspond
to channel numbers, starting with channel 0.  That is, the first port connects
to channel 0, second port to channel 1, etc.
.TP
\fBbaud-rate\fR
For serial targets, specifies the baud rate (e.g. 115200).
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B mux_server -s 57600 /dev/ttyS0 8000 8001
Attach to the serial target at /dev/ttyS0 using a baud rate of 57600 and
expose mux channel 0 on port 8000
and mux channel 1 on port 8001.
